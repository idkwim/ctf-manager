    <h2>CTF Management System</h2>
    <p>Simple CTF management system for #overflowsec.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>If you're a part of the overflowsec CTF team and landed here to get details about an ongoing or nearly arriving CTF event, please message an OP and have them send you the CTF event code.</p>
    <p>Paste the CTF event code and you will be taken to the team CTF management page. This page will contain CTF event team login credentials as well as start and end times. You will be able to claim individual event tasks via this system so everyone knows who's working on what.</p>
